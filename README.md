#Supervised-machine-learning-models


This simple supervised machine learning python notebook builds various classification models with various dataset balancing techniques and minimal hyper parameter tunning to predict whether a patient(s) has chronic illness. In future python machine learning implementations, we will explore more complex classification models.
